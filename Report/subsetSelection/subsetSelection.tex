\chapter{Subset Selection} \label{ch:subsetSelection}
Continuing on the simple linear model, this  chapter will be about selecting coefficients of features to make the model more interpretable, and in some cases to predict better. Specifying further, this chapter will be about identifying a subset of predictors that is believed to relate to the response, using Best Subset Selection and Forward/Backward Stepwise Selection.
