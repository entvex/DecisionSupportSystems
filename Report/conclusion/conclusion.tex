Throughout this report we have discussed various methods for implementing statistical concepts for supervised and unsupervised learning, in decision support systems. We have used real data from football players in the NFL and housing prices in Boston to compute linear regression models that can predict future outcome. We found improvements to the training part of regular regression by applying discriminant analysis and to the test part with re-sampling methods to enhance the model accuracy.

In the report we describe the fundamentals of statistical models used in machine learning and have gotten the basics of how to apply them in a real-life context.
