\chapter{Clustering Methods} \label{ch:clusteringMethods}
So far we have looked only at supervised learning, where a correct pair of input and output variables ($X$ and $y$) were given to train the model and verify our results. An analog to this is a teacher supervising the learning. The teacher have the correct answers and the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on our data and is corrected by the teacher. In unsupervised learning we do not have a output variable $y$, only the features $X_1$, $X_2$,...,$X_p$. This compel us to not look at predictions, but rather interesting things about the observed measurements and possibly discover subgroups in the data. We use clustering as a technique to perform unsupervised learning. In this chapter we will look at K-means and hierarchical clustering.
