\chapter{Clustering Methods} \label{ch:clusteringMethods}
In supervised learning we use a dataset with the correct data to train our model. An analog to this is
a teacher supervising the learning. The teacher have the correct answers and the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on our data and is corrected by the teacher. But in Unsupervised learning we don't have correct answers or the teacher to help us.
