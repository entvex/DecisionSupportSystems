\chapter{Bootstrap} \label{ch:bootstrap}

A second method for producing additional data from a limited data set is to use the bootstrap method. Bootstrap is performed by shaking up the data and plucking out random observations, while allowing for the same observation to be included multiple times, to create a new sample. The process can then be repeated as many times as needed until the desired amount of data becomes available. 

\subsection{Theory}

Bootstrapping works on the assumption that distribution parameters are transitive. Such that a random number generated by taking the mean of N samples from a dataset containing N samples, but allowing for replication, will be equal to a random number generated from the original population.

Dataset X contains N observations from the original population $\phi$ we resample from X until a new dataset Y with N elements is created. The mean of Y is a random number generated from the distribution of X where each observation is generated fom $\phi$. Therefore the mean of Y is an estimated observation from $\phi$.

\iffalse % Olaf: A second attempt at writing this section. Keeping it for review purposes.
Bootstrapping works by resampling the initial data with replacement, until a new data set has been created from the original. The new dataset will then contain a random sample of data with the same distribution as the original, allowing for some deviation in the parameters. By repeating this B times and averaging the distribution parameters over all B samples we get a better estimate of the original population as if we had gotten more observations.

As an example, assuming we have a normally distributed population of N elements then by taking a random resampling from that dataset until a new dataset, also containing N elements, is gained. The mean of that new dataset can then be seen as an estimated new observation from the original population. We then repeat this process B times and in the end we have a new data set of both resampled means and variances. Since both were generated using the original set of observations the set of resamples will also be normally distributed with a mean and variance close to the original population.
